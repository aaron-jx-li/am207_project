## Introduction
This is the repo for AM207 Course Project: Input-Level Attack Against Sparse Autoencoders With Evolutionary Algorithms.

The APIs related to SAEs are based on the library https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae, with some customized local package changes. The trained SAEs are loaded from https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/sae-llama-3-8b-32x.

The attack is implemented in ``evolution.py``.
